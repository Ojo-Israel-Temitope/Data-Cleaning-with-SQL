Road Accidents in the UK – SQL Data Cleaning Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and refining a dataset related to road accidents in the UK using SQL. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any analysis process, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and usability of the information. By systematically handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates, this project prepares the dataset for further analysis and insights into accident trends, contributing to better-informed decision-making for road safety improvements.

Dataset Description
-The dataset contains records of road accidents across the UK, including:
-Accident ID – Unique identifier for each accident event
-Date & Time – Timestamp of occurrence
-Location – Geographical data of the accident site
-Weather Conditions – Environmental factors at the time of the accident
-Vehicle & Driver Details – Information on involved vehicles and individuals
-Casualties & Severity – Classification of accident impact

Cleaning Objectives
To ensure the dataset is structured, reliable, and ready for analysis, the following SQL-based cleaning tasks were performed:
-Handling Missing Data – Replacing NULL values where applicable and filtering out incomplete records that could skew analysis.
-Standardizing Formats – Ensuring consistency in date formats, location names, and categorical variables.
-Removing Duplicates – Identifying and eliminating redundant records to prevent data distortion.
-Correcting Inconsistent Entries – Addressing issues such as misspellings, incorrect categorizations, and mismatched values.
-Verifying Data Integrity – Using constraints and relationships to validate logical connections between accident details.

Insights & Applications
After cleaning the dataset, the refined data can be used for various analytical purposes, including:
Identifying Accident Hotspots – Highlighting locations with frequent incidents for safety interventions.
Analyzing Contributing Factors – Examining the role of weather, time of day, and vehicle types in accident occurrence.
Policy & Infrastructure Planning – Supporting government agencies in implementing road safety measures based on historical trends.
Predictive Modeling – Enabling the development of machine learning models to anticipate high-risk scenarios.

Conclusion
By applying SQL-based cleaning techniques, this project enhances the quality and reliability of the UK road accident dataset. 
The cleaned data sets a strong foundation for further analysis, helping uncover meaningful insights that drive better road safety strategies and policy decisions.
